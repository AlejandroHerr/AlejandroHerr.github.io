## ¡Hola!

My name is Alejandro. I'm a Telecommunications Engineer from Barcleona. Und Ich habe mein Erasmus an der Technische Universität München gemacht. Currently I'm working as network and system administration. 

For some years, I have been coding, first as a hobby, then developing webapps for a non-profit students' association, [ESN UAB](https://esn.org/), I took part in (eventually I became the president of the section). 
Right now, I'm heading my career towards coding and web developing.
Self taught, I try to stay up-to-date on last trends. I started working with PHP on frameworks such as Silex and Symphony, recently I shifted to a javascript enviroment: Node.js, and React (and Redux).

Given my background, I like playing around with Raspberries and Arduinos and some electronics.

I also like to take photos that I later develop in my bathroom/dark room. I barely go out of home without my camera nor some spare rolls to shoot.


More about me? I'm a proud (Arch) Linux user, and I brewed my own beer. Twice. Also, I took part in _Saber y Ganar_, the longest running cultural quiz show in Spain, and I didn't do it that bad.

More questions? Want to hire me? Don't think twice and contact me!


### Projects
#### fotoxjs
fotoxjs is intended as a personal portofolio for my photographic work. Still work in progress, it features an horizontal scroller to display de image.
Free to use under MIT license, it's built on top of React.
Check the [repository](https://github.com/AlejandroHerr/fotoxjs) or just try the [demo](https://alejandroherr.github.io/fotoxjs/).
#### oRRDwell
oRRDwell is system monitoring tool. _Heavily_ inspired in [monitorix](http://www.monitorix.org/) but with some fundamental differences. The base is a modular bash script that gathers the system inforation and writes it to rrd files. To serve the data it uses a simple and small php server written on Silex. The frontend is written in React+Redux using D3.js.
It tries to be fully customizable with config files, so you're not tied to a layout or impementation.
Check it [here](https://github.com/AlejandroHerr/oRRDwell). And of course you can try the [demo](https://alejandroherr.github.io/oRRDwell-frontend/) of the frontend
